# Development
!!! info
    This project is open-source and it is run without any funding. It relies entirely on the good will of the maintainers and their limited free time. Please, feel free to do a PR doing any feature you may want.

This section is intended for anyone who wants to get involve on the development of the library. All PR are welcome! :stars: The only requisite is that the code is clear enough, has a well-defined goal, and it has the corresponding testing (whenever possible). Maintainers are more than welcome to help with anything you need :smiley:.

Although, we highly encourage to read the [conventions section](/development/conventions), here there is a brief resume of what you need to do to submit a successful pull request.

!!! note 
    You have already installed in your computer `python`, `docker` and `poetry` at least.

1. Fork the project.
2. Develop the code: code + **tests**.
3. Document the feature/change.
4. To run the tests: `invoke tests`.
5. If everything went okey, submit it for code review.

!!! tip
    Usually code review will take from a day to a few weeks. In case you want to use what you have already develop, you should look at [poetry repositories](https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/).
